# "Intro to Python for Working with Text" workshop series
By Filipa Calado, Princeton University

## Welcome to the series!
As one of the most popular, versatile, and beginner-friendly
programming langauges, Python can be used for a variety of tasks from
analyzing data to building websites.

This 5-part workshop series introduces participants to the Python
programming language for working with text. The first workshop begins
with core concepts, like data types, variables, functions, loops, and
conditional statements. The second and third workshops move to data
gathering and processing with web scraping, APIs, and text cleaning
methods. The fourth and fifth workshops explore text analysis with
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning tools. See a more
detailed description of each workshop below.

### Workshop overviews
**Workshop 1: “Introduction to Python Fundamentals”**
- Offers basic
  introduction to core concepts in Python programming, grounded in a
  critical awareness about data and what happens to data at various
  levels of transformation and abstraction.

**Workshop 2: “Python for Web Scraping and APIs”**
- Introduction to
  ethics, legality, and programmatic methods for extracting data from
  the web. Advances core concepts from introductory session (like loops and
  conditional statements) and adds new concepts on object-oriented
  programming and working with Python libraries. Participants practice
  scraping metadata from current “anti-trans” bills in the USA.
- libraries: `requests`, `bs4`, and `pandas`

**Workshop 3: “Python for Text Cleaning”**
- Experiments with approaches for wrangling
  text data into formats for analysis, with emphasis on removing unwanted
  elements that may skew analysis. While building on skills
  for writing loops and conditional statements and working with
  external libraries, participants will learn to write functions and
  scripts for running customized text cleaning processes.  
- libraries: `pandas`, `spacy`

**Workshop 4: “Python for Text Analysis”**
- Explores methods for finding and analyzing textual patterns through popular tasks in Natural
  Language Processing. Participants practice writing code to annotate
  and extract text according to specific features from current
  “anti-trans” bills in the USA.
- libraries: `spaCy`
  
***Workshop 5: “Python for Text Generation (with Machine Learning)”**
- With the anti-trans bills data that they prepared in previous workshops, participants practice fine-tuning a small Text Generation model and learn about how to use Machine Learning for research.
- libraries: `transformers`
