    "# the token `Matcher`\n",
    "The token `Matcher` is very similar to the `PhraseMatcher` from two sections before. The difference is that this `Matcher` is allows for more variation, so we can capture different forms of the same basic pattern. For example, we could get definitions of gender (and sex, and sexuality) that use different words (like \"means\" or \"includes\") or kinds of punctuation (like single or double quotes) in the defintition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The token `Matcher` works by writing a pattern of tokens that we define using the token attributes. We can, for example, leverage the work we did with the `EntityRuler` in the previous section to help create our token `Matcher`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will import the matcher to create a matcher object. Then, we will write patterns and save them. After that, we add our new patterns to the matcher. Finally, we will run the matcher on our document. The steps are the following:\n",
    "1. write patterns to matcher\n",
    "2. configure and run matcher\n",
    "3. print the results\n",
