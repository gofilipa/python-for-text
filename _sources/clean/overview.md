# workshop overview

## learning objectives

This workshop builds on the previous workshops to clean and process
text based data from current anti-trans legisation. Participants will
practice using Python to transform data from a raw and messy format
into an analyzable, structured format in a spreadsheet. To manipulate
text data into tabular formats, they will work primarily with Python's
built-in "string methods" and the `pandas` library. Participants will
learn how to write custom functions clean this text data in
preparation for text analysis. 

This workshop introduces:
- the `pandas` libary for working with tabular data
- string methods in Python for working with text data
- ooping through text data to do things en masse to text
- how to customize functions for data processing

## anti-trans legislation
The past couple of years have seen an explosion in anti-trans
legislation that restricts basic rights and recognition for trans
people. In 2023, more than 500 bills were proposed that prevent trans
people from using bathrooms, playing in sports, accessing healthcare,
and more in ways that accord with their gender identity. Of those 500
proposals across state legislatures, 87 passed. Compare that number
with last year, 2022, 174 bills were proposed, and 26 passed. See the
[Trans Legislation Tracker](https://translegislation.com/) for more information.
