# workshop overview

## learning objectives
This workshop explores how the Python programming language takes data, organizes it into collections or groupings, with the goal of doing something to that data. 

It introduces:

- data types and variables for categorizing and saving data
- functions and methods for working with data
- iterative and logical structures
- basic Python syntax

## Google Colab environment
There are many ways to use Python. For this "Intro to Python" workshop, we will be using
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), a browser-based tool
for running Python code. Like Google Docs, Google Colab creates a
collaborative environment hosted on the Google cloud for authoring content.

Whereas most Python environments require installations (some of which
can be really complicated), Google Colab offers Python software
pre-installed on the cloud environment. It enables new users to
jump right into programming.  

Google Colab creates an interactive coding environment where you can
enter a Python expression into the black text box, called a \"cell\",
and execute, or \"run,\" the expression by pressing enter. Please see
[this
tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) for
specifics on how to run Python within the Google Colab environment.
