    "Computer software (not even large-language models!) do not process and understand human language the way humans do. For example, everything that humans consider a \"word,\" and all of the meanings associated with that word, becomes a simple `string` to a computer, a sequence of alphanumeric characters wrapped by quotation marks. To a computer, a `string` like \"ocean\" has no semantic meaning, though a large enough computer (like a large-language model) can process enough strings to get a sense of where \"ocean\" should fall in a sentence, and what words should surround it, perhaps \"deep\" or \"blue\". But, as I explain in workshop 5 on Generating Text, this kind of understanding is a statistical inference, and doesn't mean that the computer associates depth or color with the ocean, not to mention the various sensations that such words can evoke in humans. \n",

    "Transforming real world information into computer-readable data inevitably reduces or simplifies the original. Data types thus create a particular kind of *constraint* on data. That being said, these kind of constraints can also be productive ones. Each data type comes with a number of `methods` that can be used on that particular type. You can do things with integers that you cannot do with strings, for example. You can add numbers together, but not strings. \n",

    "While you're still a beginner, the differences in data types will likely create headaches as you learn by errors (many, many errors) what methods can and cannot accept certain types of data. Data types will feel like a nuisance, preventing you from doing what you want to your data. But as you advance, you'll learn to leverage the different types to manipulate data in amazing ways."
